# A major oversight now resolved
NothingK had a bug in version 0.3.17-Phasmophobia.3 that prevented you from editing passwords. This bug has been fixed in the latest version (0.3.17-Phasmophobia.4). From now on, NothingK will have a new code review system that will reduce the likelihood of this type of bug to 0%. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
